## What I learned
Have worked with lot of DOM manipulating methods ,but this time wanted to implement DOM manipulation using JQuery Api's which reduces code length. Some of the Jquery api's used in this project are:
1. `text()`
2. `addClass()`
3. `removeClass`
4. `fadeIn()`
5. `fadeOut()`
6. `attr()`
7. `click()`
8. `keypress()`

JQuery documentation to know more in depth about these api's and many other's: <br>
